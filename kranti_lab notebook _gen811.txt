##New cammand -nano: creates a new file or opens a file for writing later
# create a new file named newfile.txt in the untrimmed_fastq directory
nano newfile.txt # create a file with that name
nano # creates a file that you need to name later

to open the file to make sure this worked 
## new cammand -less: open files for reading (talk about head vs cat vs less)
less newfile.txt ( opens a file for reading, press q to exit)

## cat newfile.txt ( prints the whole file to the screen)
## head newfile.txt ( prints the first 10 file lines to the screen)

## add more text to newfile.txt using nano
nano newfile.txt

## new cammand -mkdir: creates a new directory/folder
# create a new directory named tmp_files
mkdir tmp_files
mkdir ../sra_metadata/tmp_files

## mkdir ../sra_metadata/tmp_files
# cd ../sra_metadata/

#cd ../untrimmed_fastq

### new cammand -mv:moves files
## move the newfile.txt to the tmp_files directory - can do absolute and relative PATH
mv newfile.txt tmp_files

### copy (cp)
to make a copy of one of our FASTQ files using the cp command.
Navigate to the shell_data/untrimmed_fastq directory and enter:
cp SRR098026.fastq SRR098026-copy.fastq


## review cat,grep,wc,and pipes
## first take a look at the fastq files
## shoold we use the less,cat or head cammand?
head SRR097977.fastq
cat SRR097977.fastq
less SRR097977.fastq

## figure out how many different reads have in one of our fastq file 
grep to find match or searching tool
pipe | to run multiple cammand
grep "@" SRR097977.fastq
grep "@" SRR097977.fastq | wc -l # to check how mwny reads in the fastq file 
274 different reads
# grep "@" SRR098026.fastq | wc -l


## we can put this different reads of count information into new file 

grep "@" SRR097977.fastq | wc -l > fastq_count.txt  overwritting   eg echo "N" > KK_G
grep "@" SRR098026.fastq | wc -l >> fastq_count.txt appendingcd    eg echo "N" >> KK_G


lets make a folder in kranti_811 specifically for fastq files

to naviagate _gen811
###cd ../../.. relative path
cd /mnt/c/Users/KRANTI/Desktop/Workspace_GEN811   absolute path

## create a new directory named fastq_files
mkdir fastq_files

###to see the date when we have created the file
## ls -l 

### new cammand -cp: copies file 
## without navigating back to the untrimmed_fastq directory, copy all fastq files to this directory
this is where wildcards come in handy 
copy all fastq files in untrimmed_fastq directory in fastq_files
cp shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/*.fastq fastq_files

to check cd in to fastq_files
ls to see

# now navigate to the tmp_fileswe created in the untrimmed_fastq directory
cd /mnt/c/Users/KRANTI/Desktop/Workspace_GEN811/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq/tmp_files

##3 new cammand 
## rm to delete files
## ctrl c if it asks for a password

## final ls -l in gen 811 folder to show all the files/directories
##cd ../../../.. 
## ls -l

# For the practical: Please put 'cd /absolute/path/to/gen711' at the top of your notes pages

## lab 5 notebook 
Practice practical  

### Change your working directory to your gen711 folder with an absolute path
cd /mnt/c/Users/KRANTI/Desktop/Workspace_GEN811


### Change your working directory to the 'shell data' folder
cd shell_data/untrimmed_fastq

## how many lines do each of the fastq have in this directory 
inefficient way
wc -l SRR098026.fastq #996
wc -l SRR097977.fastq #996
efficent way 
wc -l *.fastq 
there are 4 lines for each read in a fastq file so if we have 996 lines we have 996/4 = 249 reads

##How many sequences are there in SRR098026.fastq? Remember that every sequence is formed by four lines.
wc -l
996 
996/4

# to count words 
wc file name

##to find number of lines or sequences in the file
wc -l

How many sequences in SRR098026.fastq contain at least 3 consecutive Ns?
grep "NNN" SRR098026.fastq | wc -l


### Use grep to search for a bad read in SRR098026.fastq( any read with 15 uncalled bases in a row )

grep "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" SRR098026.fastq

### Use the 'B' option to get line above each match 

grep options -B (before) and -A (after)

grep -B1 "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" SRR098026.fastq

### How many lines in the grep output belong to a read?
2 lines

### How many lines in the original fastq belong to a read?
head SRR098026.fastq
  or 
less SRR098026.fastq
4 lines (2 header lines,1 base calls, 1 base call quality)
(enter q to get out of the file)

### Use the 'A' and 'B' options with grep to return the read and all 4 lines for each match
grep -A2 -B1 "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" SRR098026.fastq

### Redirect the bad reads in SRR098026.fastq to a file called bad_reads.fastq 

grep -A2 -B1 "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" SRR098026.fastq > bad_reads.fastq
grep -A2 -B1 "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" SRR098026.fastq > SRR098026_bad_reads.fastq

### Determine how many lines are in bad_reads.fastq
wc -l SRR098026_bad_reads.fastq

### Redirect the bad reads for both fastqs into bad_reads.txt at the same time
hint - use globe (*)


grep -A2 -B1 "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" *fastq > bad_reads.fastq

### Determine how many bad read lines are in each of the fastq lines, and compare that
 with the number of lines in bad_reads.fastq

 How many lines do each of the fastqs have in this directory?

wc -l *.fastq

###each read should have 4 lines per match but foe some reason,fastq has 401 lines we need to find out what happend.
Have a look in the file to find out what is wrong 
less bad_reads.fastq

scroll all the way to thye bottom with less 
  or 
tail bad_reads.fastq

use reverse grep to remove the lines that

### Use a reverse grep to remove the lines that 
grep -A2 -B1 "NNNNNNNNNNNNNN" SRR098026.fastq | grep -v "^\-\-" > bad_reads.fastq  


### Add your name to the bottom of the bad_reads.fastq 
nano bad_reads.fastqqq

name it and check with less if it worked
      or
echo "kranti g " >> bad_reads.fastq

### Add your name to the top of the bad_reads.fastq 
use nano bad_reads.fastq
ckeck with less if it worked 

### Make a script that makes a file of bad reads 

###Change the permissions on all of your backup files to be write-protected.
chmod -w backup/*-backup.fastq

### change the permissions of the file and run the script
chmod 755 file_name

### add your name to the end of new bad reads file
ls > list.txt or use nano 
### Run md5sum on scripted_bad_reads.txt and write the output to my_md5sum.txt


List all of the files in /usr/bin that start with the letter ‘c’.   ls /usr/bin/c*
List all of the files in /usr/bin that contain the letter ‘a’.     ls /usr/bin/*a* 
List all of the files in /usr/bin that end with the letter ‘o’.    ls /usr/bin/*o

List all of the files in /usr/bin that contain the letter ‘a’ or the letter ‘c’.    ls /usr/bin/*[ac]*

grep is a powerful search tool with many options for customization.
>, >>, and | are different ways of redirecting output.
command > file redirects a command’s output to a file.
command >> file redirects a command’s output to a file without overwriting the existing contents of the file.
command_1 | command_2 redirects the output of the first command as input to the second command.
